# Mercy Birungi - Outreachy Application

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Mercy Birungi, and I'm captivated by what Wagtail represents. Wagtail is more than just an open-source content management system (CMS) built on Django; it's a platform that embodies the spirit of accessible and impactful content creation. Its reputation among developers and content editors is well-deserved, thanks to its powerful features and an intuitive interface that fosters a seamless content editing experience.

What sets Wagtail apart and why it resonates with me is its commitment to inclusivity. It's not just about managing content; it's about making sure that the digital world is accessible to all, regardless of their abilities. This aligns perfectly with my passion for technology's transformative power and my desire to bridge the gap between data science and software development.

I am specifically interested in Wagtail project #1 because I would like to improve my technical writing abilities 

## Why Outreachy and Open Source?

I'm here because I believe in the mission of Outreachy and the power of open source collaboration. Outreachy offers a unique opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects, like those involving Wagtail, while also promoting diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.
